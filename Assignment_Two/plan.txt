Given: Array of triplets with height, left bound and right bound.
    These triplets create buildings.

Goal: Eliminate overlap and only draw the outer border of the skyline.

Based on the assignment instructions example, we can assume that the building tuples are ordered in ascending order based on x positons for the left bound.

Important things to consider:
    1. If a building overlaps with the next one, then we should record the right bound. If the next building ends up inside the 1st building, then return to the original height.
    2. If there is no building (empty space) after the right bound and before the left bound of the next building, drop height to 0.
    3. If a building overlaps over more than 1 other structure, then we should record the right bounds in an array in ascending order of distance. This is to return to the height of the respective building.
            Perhaps store previous height and right bound in the array to easily get the values. Store based on right bound value.
    4. If the bulding is the last index, then drop the height to 0 at the end. Also start at 0 for the beginning.
