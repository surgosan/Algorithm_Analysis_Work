    Define Program Functions here

## Input
Accepts a csv file as defined in the assignment instructions.
 
Define the csv file on `line 9` as follows: 

    './<File Name>.csv'

The csv should be structured similar to the example on the assignment instructions

    Building Height, Left Bound Position, Right Bound Position
    |
    Repeat

The program assumes that the data points are ordered in ascending order by `Left Bound Position`.
The same way that the assigment example is ordered.

## Output

<u>*Output is printed to the terminal and csv file*.</u>

    Height, X position
    |
    Repeat

Official output is written to `output.csv`
